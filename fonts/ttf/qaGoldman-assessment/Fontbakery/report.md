<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Check that OS/2.fsSelection bold & italic settings are unique for each NameID1</summary>

* [com.adobe.fonts/check/family/bold_italic_unique_for_nameid1](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/os2.html#com.adobe.fonts/check/family/bold_italic_unique_for_nameid1)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Per the OpenType spec: name ID 1 &#x27;is used in combination with Font Subfamily
name (name ID 2), and should be shared among at most four fonts that differ
only in weight or style...

This four-way distinction should also be reflected in the OS/2.fsSelection
field, using bits 0 and 5.


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** Family 'Gold' has 2 fonts (should be no more than 1) with the same OS/2.fsSelection bold & italic settings: Bold=False, Italic=False

* [com.google.fonts/check/fstype](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/fstype)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

The fsType in the OS/2 table is a legacy DRM-related field. Fonts in the Google
Fonts collection must have it set to zero (also known as &quot;Installable
Embedding&quot;). This setting indicates that the fonts can be embedded in documents
and permanently installed by applications on remote systems.

More detailed info is available at:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#fstype


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** In this font fsType is set to 8 meaning that:
The font may be embedded but must only be installed temporarily on other systems.

No such DRM restrictions can be enabled on the Google Fonts collection, so the fsType field must be set to zero (Installable Embedding) instead. [code: drm]

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Checking OS/2 usWeightClass.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/usweightclass](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/usweightclass)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Google Fonts expects variable fonts, static ttfs and static otfs to have
differing OS/2 usWeightClass values.

For Variable Fonts, Thin-Black must be 100-900
For static ttfs, Thin-Black can be 100-900 or 250-900
For static otfs, Thin-Black must be 250-900

If static otfs are set lower than 250, text may appear blurry in legacy Windows
applications.

Glyphsapp users can change the usWeightClass value of an instance by adding a
&#x27;weightClass&#x27; customParameter.


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** OS/2 usWeightClass is '400' when it should be '700'. [code: bad-value]

An OFL.txt file&#x27;s first line should be the font copyright e.g:
&quot;Copyright 2019 The Montserrat Project Authors
(https://github.com/julietaula/montserrat)&quot;

<pre>--- Rationale ---

A known licensing description must be provided in the NameID 14 (LICENSE
DESCRIPTION) entries of the name table.

The source of truth for this check (to determine which license is in use) is a
file placed side-by-side to your font project including the licensing terms.

Depending on the chosen license, one of the following string snippets is
expected to be found on the NameID 13 (LICENSE DESCRIPTION) entries of the name
table:
- &quot;This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is available with a FAQ at: https://scripts.sil.org/OFL&quot;

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Are there non-ASCII characters in ASCII-only NAME table entries?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/name/ascii_only_entries](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/name/ascii_only_entries)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

The OpenType spec requires ASCII for the POSTSCRIPT_NAME (nameID 6).

For COPYRIGHT_NOTICE (nameID 0) ASCII is required because that string should be
the same in CFF fonts which also have this requirement in the OpenType spec.

Note:
A common place where we find non-ASCII strings is on name table entries with
NameID &gt; 18, which are expressly for localising the ASCII-only IDs into Hindi /
Arabic / etc.


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** Bad string at [nameID 0, 'mac_roman']: 'b'Copyright &#169; 2018 by jaiki. All rights reserved.'' [code: bad-string]

* [com.google.fonts/check/mac_style](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/mac_style)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

The values of the flags on the macStyle entry on the &#x27;head&#x27; OpenType table that
describe whether a font is bold and/or italic must be coherent with the actual
style of the font as inferred by its filename.


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** head macStyle BOLD bit should be set. [code: bad-BOLD]

</details>
<details>
<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Check name table: FONT_FAMILY_NAME entries.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/name/familyname](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/name/familyname)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Checks that the family name infered from the font filename matches the string
at nameID 1 (NAMEID_FONT_FAMILY_NAME) if it conforms to RIBBI and otherwise
checks that nameID 1 is the family name + the style name.


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** Entry [FONT_FAMILY_NAME(1):WINDOWS(3)] on the "name" table: Expected "Gold" but got "Gold Bold". [code: mismatch]

</details>
<details>
<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Check name table: FONT_SUBFAMILY_NAME entries.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/name/subfamilyname](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/name/subfamilyname)

* [com.google.fonts/check/name/typographicfamilyname](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/name/typographicfamilyname)

* 🔥 **FAIL** Font style is "Bold" and, for that reason, it is not expected to have a [TYPOGRAPHIC_FAMILY_NAME(16):WINDOWS(3)] entry! [code: ribbi]

</details>
<details>
<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> PPEM must be an integer on hinted fonts.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/integer_ppem_if_hinted](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/integer_ppem_if_hinted)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Hinted fonts must have head table flag bit 3 set.

Per https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/head, bit 3 of
Head::flags decides whether PPEM should be rounded. This bit should always be
set for hinted fonts.

Note:
Bit 3 = Force ppem to integer values for all internal scaler math;
        May use fractional ppem sizes if this bit is clear;


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** This is a hinted font, so it must have bit 3 set on the flags of the head table, so that PPEM values will be rounded into an integer value.

This can be accomplished by using the 'gftools fix-hinting' command.

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Name table entries should not contain line-breaks.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/name/line_breaks](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/name/line_breaks)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

There are some entries on the name table that may include more than one line of
text. The Google Fonts team, though, prefers to keep the name table entries
short and simple without line breaks.

For instance, some designers like to include the full text of a font license in
the &quot;copyright notice&quot; entry, but for the GFonts collection this entry should
only mention year, author and other basic info in a manner enforced by
com.google.fonts/check/font_copyright


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** Name entry LICENSE_DESCRIPTION on platform MACINTOSH contains a line-break. [code: line-break]
* 🔥 **FAIL** Name entry LICENSE_DESCRIPTION on platform WINDOWS contains a line-break. [code: line-break]

</details>
<details>
<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Checking OS/2 usWinAscent & usWinDescent.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/family/win_ascent_and_descent](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/family/win_ascent_and_descent)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head
table&#x27;s yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping
can occur on Windows platforms
(https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the
yMax and abs(yMin).


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** OS/2.usWinAscent value should be equal or greater than 1084, but got 956 instead [code: ascent]
* 🔥 **FAIL** OS/2.usWinDescent value should be equal or greater than 680, but got 244 instead [code: descent]

</details>

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Checking OS/2 Metrics match hhea Metrics.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/os2_metrics_match_hhea](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/os2_metrics_match_hhea)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

When OS/2 and hhea vertical metrics match, the same linespacing results on
macOS, GNU+Linux and Windows. Unfortunately as of 2018, Google Fonts has
released many fonts with vertical metrics that don&#x27;t match in this way. When we
fix this issue in these existing families, we will create a visible change in
line/paragraph layout for either Windows or macOS users, which will upset some
of them.

But we have a duty to fix broken stuff, and inconsistent paragraph layout is
unacceptably broken when it is possible to avoid it.

If users complain and prefer the old broken version, they have the freedom to
take care of their own situation.


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** OS/2 sTypoAscender (756) and hhea ascent (956) must be equal. [code: ascender]

<summary>🔥 <b>FAIL:</b> Glyph names are all valid?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/valid_glyphnames](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/valid_glyphnames)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Microsoft&#x27;s recommendations for OpenType Fonts states the following:

&#x27;NOTE: The PostScript glyph name must be no longer than 31 characters, include
only uppercase or lowercase English letters, European digits, the period or the
underscore, i.e. from the set [A-Za-z0-9_.] and should start with a letter,
except the special glyph name &quot;.notdef&quot; which starts with a period.&#x27;

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/recom#post-table


In practice, though, particularly in modern environments, glyph names can be as
long as 63 characters.
According to the &quot;Adobe Glyph List Specification&quot; available at:

https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/agl-specification


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** The following glyph names do not comply with naming conventions: nonmarkingreturn#1

 such as the special character ".notdef". The glyph names "twocents", "a1", and "_" are all valid, while "2cents" and ".twocents" are not. [code: found-invalid-names]

* [com.google.fonts/check/unique_glyphnames](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/unique_glyphnames)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Duplicate glyph names prevent font installation on Mac OS X.


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** The following glyph names occur twice: ['nonmarkingreturn']

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Checking OS/2 achVendID.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/vendor_id](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/vendor_id)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Microsoft keeps a list of font vendors and their respective contact info. This
list is updated regularly and is indexed by a 4-char &quot;Vendor ID&quot; which is
stored in the achVendID field of the OS/2 table.

Registering your ID is not mandatory, but it is a good practice since some
applications may display the type designer / type foundry contact info on some
dialog and also because that info will be visible on Microsoft&#x27;s website:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/vendors/

This check verifies whether or not a given font&#x27;s vendor ID is registered in
that list or if it has some of the default values used by the most common font
editors.

Each new FontBakery release includes a cached copy of that list of vendor IDs.
If you registered recently, you&#x27;re safe to ignore warnings emitted by this
check, since your ID will soon be included in one of our upcoming releases.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** OS/2 VendorID is 'UKWN', a font editor default. If you registered it recently, then it's safe to ignore this warning message. Otherwise, you should set it to your own unique 4 character code, and register it with Microsoft at https://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/vendorlist.aspx

<pre>--- Rationale ---

A known license URL must be provided in the NameID 14 (LICENSE INFO URL) entry
of the name table.

The source of truth for this check is the licensing text found on the NameID 13

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Stricter unitsPerEm criteria for Google Fonts. </summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/unitsperem_strict](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/unitsperem_strict)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Even though the OpenType spec allows unitsPerEm to be any value between 16 and
16384, the Google Fonts project aims at a narrower set of reasonable values.

The spec suggests usage of powers of two in order to get some performance
improvements on legacy renderers, so those values are acceptable.

But value of 500 or 1000 are also acceptable, with the added benefit that it
makes upm math easier for designers, while the performance hit of not using a
power of two is most likely negligible nowadays.

Another acceptable value is 2000. Since TT outlines are all integers (no
floats), then instances in a VF suffer rounding compromises, and therefore a
1000 UPM is too small because it forces too many such compromises.

Therefore 2000 is a good &#x27;new VF standard&#x27;, because 2000 is a simple 2x
conversion from existing fonts drawn on a 1000 UPM, and anyone who knows what
10 units can do for 1000 UPM will know what 20 units does too.

Additionally, values above 2048 would result in filesize increases with not
much added benefit.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** Even though unitsPerEm (1000) in this font is reasonable. It is strongly advised to consider changing it to 2000, since it will likely improve the quality of Variable Fonts by avoiding excessive rounding of coordinates on interpolations. [code: legacy-value]

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Check if each glyph has the recommended amount of contours.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

The following glyphs do not have the recommended number of contours:

Glyph name: uni20A8	Contours detected: 1	Expected: 3
Glyph name: fl	Contours detected: 1	Expected: 2
Glyph name: fi	Contours detected: 1	Expected: 3 [code: contour-count]

* [com.google.fonts/check/fstype](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/fstype)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

The fsType in the OS/2 table is a legacy DRM-related field. Fonts in the Google
Fonts collection must have it set to zero (also known as &quot;Installable
Embedding&quot;). This setting indicates that the fonts can be embedded in documents
and permanently installed by applications on remote systems.

More detailed info is available at:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#fstype


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** In this font fsType is set to 8 meaning that:
The font may be embedded but must only be installed temporarily on other systems.

No such DRM restrictions can be enabled on the Google Fonts collection, so the fsType field must be set to zero (Installable Embedding) instead. [code: drm]

<pre>--- Rationale ---

The OpenType spec requires ASCII for the POSTSCRIPT_NAME (nameID 6).

For COPYRIGHT_NOTICE (nameID 0) ASCII is required because that string should be
the same in CFF fonts which also have this requirement in the OpenType spec.

Note:
A common place where we find non-ASCII strings is on name table entries with

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Hinted fonts must have head table flag bit 3 set.

Per https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/head, bit 3 of
Head::flags decides whether PPEM should be rounded. This bit should always be
set for hinted fonts.

Note:
Bit 3 = Force ppem to integer values for all internal scaler math;
        May use fractional ppem sizes if this bit is clear;


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** This is a hinted font, so it must have bit 3 set on the flags of the head table, so that PPEM values will be rounded into an integer value.

This can be accomplished by using the 'gftools fix-hinting' command.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

There are some entries on the name table that may include more than one line of
text. The Google Fonts team, though, prefers to keep the name table entries
short and simple without line breaks.

For instance, some designers like to include the full text of a font license in
the &quot;copyright notice&quot; entry, but for the GFonts collection this entry should
only mention year, author and other basic info in a manner enforced by
com.google.fonts/check/font_copyright

<pre>--- Rationale ---

A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head
table&#x27;s yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping
can occur on Windows platforms
(https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).

If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari,
the winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.

When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing
can appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead.
This means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the
yMax and abs(yMin).

<pre>--- Rationale ---

When OS/2 and hhea vertical metrics match, the same linespacing results on
macOS, GNU+Linux and Windows. Unfortunately as of 2018, Google Fonts has
released many fonts with vertical metrics that don&#x27;t match in this way. When we
fix this issue in these existing families, we will create a visible change in
line/paragraph layout for either Windows or macOS users, which will upset some
of them.

But we have a duty to fix broken stuff, and inconsistent paragraph layout is
unacceptably broken when it is possible to avoid it.

If users complain and prefer the old broken version, they have the freedom to
take care of their own situation.

* [com.google.fonts/check/valid_glyphnames](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/valid_glyphnames)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Microsoft&#x27;s recommendations for OpenType Fonts states the following:

&#x27;NOTE: The PostScript glyph name must be no longer than 31 characters, include
only uppercase or lowercase English letters, European digits, the period or the
underscore, i.e. from the set [A-Za-z0-9_.] and should start with a letter,
except the special glyph name &quot;.notdef&quot; which starts with a period.&#x27;

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/recom#post-table


In practice, though, particularly in modern environments, glyph names can be as
long as 63 characters.
According to the &quot;Adobe Glyph List Specification&quot; available at:

https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/agl-specification


</pre>

* 🔥 **FAIL** The following glyph names do not comply with naming conventions: nonmarkingreturn#1

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Microsoft keeps a list of font vendors and their respective contact info. This
list is updated regularly and is indexed by a 4-char &quot;Vendor ID&quot; which is
stored in the achVendID field of the OS/2 table.

Registering your ID is not mandatory, but it is a good practice since some
applications may display the type designer / type foundry contact info on some
dialog and also because that info will be visible on Microsoft&#x27;s website:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/vendors/

This check verifies whether or not a given font&#x27;s vendor ID is registered in
that list or if it has some of the default values used by the most common font
editors.

Each new FontBakery release includes a cached copy of that list of vendor IDs.
If you registered recently, you&#x27;re safe to ignore warnings emitted by this
check, since your ID will soon be included in one of our upcoming releases.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** OS/2 VendorID is 'UKWN', a font editor default. If you registered it recently, then it's safe to ignore this warning message. Otherwise, you should set it to your own unique 4 character code, and register it with Microsoft at https://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/vendorlist.aspx

* [com.google.fonts/check/unitsperem_strict](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/unitsperem_strict)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Even though the OpenType spec allows unitsPerEm to be any value between 16 and
16384, the Google Fonts project aims at a narrower set of reasonable values.

The spec suggests usage of powers of two in order to get some performance
improvements on legacy renderers, so those values are acceptable.

But value of 500 or 1000 are also acceptable, with the added benefit that it
makes upm math easier for designers, while the performance hit of not using a
power of two is most likely negligible nowadays.

Another acceptable value is 2000. Since TT outlines are all integers (no
floats), then instances in a VF suffer rounding compromises, and therefore a
1000 UPM is too small because it forces too many such compromises.

Therefore 2000 is a good &#x27;new VF standard&#x27;, because 2000 is a simple 2x
conversion from existing fonts drawn on a 1000 UPM, and anyone who knows what
10 units can do for 1000 UPM will know what 20 units does too.

Additionally, values above 2048 would result in filesize increases with not
much added benefit.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** Even though unitsPerEm (1000) in this font is reasonable. It is strongly advised to consider changing it to 2000, since it will likely improve the quality of Variable Fonts by avoiding excessive rounding of coordinates on interpolations. [code: legacy-value]

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Check if each glyph has the recommended amount of contours.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

The following glyphs do not have the recommended number of contours:

Glyph name: uni20A8	Contours detected: 1	Expected: 3
Glyph name: fl	Contours detected: 1	Expected: 2
Glyph name: fi	Contours detected: 1	Expected: 3 [code: contour-count]
