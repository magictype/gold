A day, I found myself melting inside. Melted for long. Really long. I have no words to describe the feeling. Like fading away. It was immensely painful until I saw that sheen and shine. Like rising sun. Like gold. I stood gazing at myself to see if I was the same person. I was smiling in pain, leaving behind everything that I thought I was made of. Those countless things inside me could never make me smile this way before. Who gave me all the courage to stand that heat? I don't know. What if I had a choice? What if I had a master escape plan? The story would have been totally different. **If only had I chosen not to burn, I would have never seen all that was not Gold. I am more like me than ever before.**
